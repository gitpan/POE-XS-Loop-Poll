This is the change history of POE::XS::Loop::Poll.

0.004 Mon Jul  7 11:08:24 EST 2008
 - depend on POE::Test::Loops 1.002 for new tests
 - fix handling of error events
 - fix tracing of poll() results
 - remove some old non-"standard" tracing
 - bump for release

0.003 Thu Jul  3 11:07:39 EST 2008
 - depend on POE::Test::Loops 1.001 and use the new generate() function
   instead of running poe-gen-tests.
 - bump for release

0.002 Wed Jul  2 14:13:06 EST 2008
 - fix {configure,build}_requires to POE::Test::Loops instead of
   POE::Test::Loop.  Since many of the CPAN testers are still broken
   wrt configure_requires I'll still get failures, but they'll be 
   someone elses fault.

0.001 Fri Jun 27 16:57:49 EST 2008
