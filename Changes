This is the change history of POE::XS::Loop::Poll.

1.00 Sun Mar  7 12:51:48 EST 2010

 - eliminate trailing newlines from trace messages to avoid PID spam
   in the trace

 - use the Time::HiRes NVTime entry if available instead of calling
   gettimeofday().

 - methods check the loop has been initialized, since some loading
   mechanisms load two loops and initialize only one.

0.007 Mon Feb  2 11:43:46 EST 2009
 - add t/poe_xs_loop_poll/*.t to the list of files deleted by make clean
 - set the new POE_LOOP_USES_POLL from POE::Test::Loops 1.003 to skip
   tests with ptys on OS X (darwin).
 - remove "requires" for POE::Loop::Tests, it's only needed during
   configure and test
 - bump to 0.007 for release

0.006 Sun Jul 20 09:13:44 EST 2008
 - expected poll failures no longer result in a warning.  RT #37507
 - unexpected poll failures now result in a call to 
   POE::Kernel::_trap() just as they do for the built-in loops.
   RT #37507
 - bump to 0.006

0.005 Tue Jul  8 10:26:07 EST 2008
 - add a typemap entry for PerlIO for older perls
 - bump to 0.005

0.004 Mon Jul  7 11:08:24 EST 2008
 - depend on POE::Test::Loops 1.002 for new tests
 - fix handling of error events
 - fix tracing of poll() results
 - remove some old non-"standard" tracing
 - bump for release

0.003 Thu Jul  3 11:07:39 EST 2008
 - depend on POE::Test::Loops 1.001 and use the new generate() function
   instead of running poe-gen-tests.
 - bump for release

0.002 Wed Jul  2 14:13:06 EST 2008
 - fix {configure,build}_requires to POE::Test::Loops instead of
   POE::Test::Loop.  Since many of the CPAN testers are still broken
   wrt configure_requires I'll still get failures, but they'll be 
   someone elses fault.

0.001 Fri Jun 27 16:57:49 EST 2008
 - initial release
