=head1 NAME

POE::XS::Loop::Poll - an XS implementation of POE::Loop, using poll(2).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POE::Kernel { loop => 'POE::XS::Loop::Poll' };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface
written in C using the poll(2) system call.

Signals are left to POE::Loop::PerlSignals.

=head1 SEE ALSO

POE, POE::Kernel, POE::Loop.

=head1 BUGS

Relies upon small fd numbers, but then a lot of code does.

Will fail badly if your code uses POE from more than one Perl thread.

=head1 LICENSE

POE::XS::Loop::Poll is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.
