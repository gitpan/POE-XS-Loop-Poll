POE::XS::Loop::Poll is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop
interface written in C using the poll(2) system call.

So your system will need to have the poll(2) system call available,
and appropriate headers.

To install:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install  # you may need to be root for this step

If you need to use POE's TRACE_FILES, TRACE_EVENTS or TRACE_STATISTICS
facilities, you need to run Makefile.PL with the --trace option:

  perl Makefile.PL --trace
  make
  make test
  make install

This will result in a slight reduction in performance, even if none of
POE's trace flags are enabled.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
